In this poster I highlighted the work done in McClintock+ (2018a,b). I show preliminary results of our constraints on the cluster mass--richness relation from DES weak lensing data around redMaPPer galaxy clusters, while detailing how we dealt with the numerous sources of systematic on both the lensing and mass estimation sides. Then I show the halo mass function emulator I constructed, and finally leave off with a slide showing early cosmology results from the re-analysis of DES redMaPPer clusters.
