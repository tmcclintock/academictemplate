Astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, soon to be at Brookhaven National Lab.

## Professional

Working in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology, I recently obtained my doctorate in physics from the University of Arizona. My thesis was completed under [Eduardo Rozo](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/eduardo-rozo) and is titled "Galaxy Clusters in the Dark Energy Survey".


## Personal
Sometimes, I have free time and when I do I like to do things!
