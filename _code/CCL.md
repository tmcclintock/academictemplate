## Summary
This library is the primary tool for theoretical calculations to be used by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration as part of LSST. The library computes distances, correlation functions, and halo properties, while allowing for seemless integration with different routines for calculating the matter power spectrum. As a main contributor, I helped develop much of the Python front end as well as most of the documentation.
